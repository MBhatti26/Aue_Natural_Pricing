The currently activated Python version 3.14.0 is not supported by the project (>=3.9,<3.13).
Trying to find and use a compatible version.

The current project's supported Python range (>=3.9,<3.11) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
  - numpy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.9,<3.11
  - numpy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.9,<3.11
  - numpy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.9,<3.11
  - numpy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.9,<3.11
  - numpy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be installable for Python >=3.9,<3.11

Because no versions of numpy match >2.3.0,<2.3.1 || >2.3.1,<2.3.2 || >2.3.2,<2.3.3 || >2.3.3,<2.3.4 || >2.3.4
 and numpy (2.3.0) requires Python >=3.11, numpy is forbidden.
And because numpy (2.3.1) requires Python >=3.11, numpy is forbidden.
And because numpy (2.3.2) requires Python >=3.11
 and numpy (2.3.3) requires Python >=3.11, numpy is forbidden.
So, because numpy (2.3.4) requires Python >=3.11
 and aue-natural-pricing depends on numpy (>=2.3.0), version solving failed.
